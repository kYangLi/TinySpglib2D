# TinySpglib2D

A tiny C++ program for analysis 2D materials with spglib.

- Support VASP ``POSCAR`` only, so far.
- the [spglib](https://github.com/spglib/spglib) must be installed. (See ``./external``)
- Change the `lib` and `include` path in `./runme.sh`
- Run `./runme.sh` directly, if you are under ``*nix`` system.
- Type `./spglib_2d_tovasp.x -h` for more help.
